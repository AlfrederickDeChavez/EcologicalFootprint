# Digging Insights about Ecological Footprint and Sustainable Development through Exploratory Data Analysis
Global Ecological Footprint Analysis

## Introduction
Humanity depends on Earth for resources to fulfill their needs including food, air, water, minerals, soil, energy, plants and animals. Some of these resources are renewable and can be replaced but there will come a time that the non-renewable resources will be depleted. When people eat their food, drink water, use electronic devices and drive their car, they are contributing to the depletion of resources.

The problem of resource depletion is not necessarily limited to the consumption of the resources itself but the unsustainable and irresponsible ways people and industries use them. It starts on the households when people: 

* Leave the lights on when it is not in use which consumes unnecessary energy that cannot be regenerated.
* Use their computers and smartphones excessively which contributes to the increase of carbon footprint. 
* Boils too much water when cooking or preparing something to eat or drink. 
* Leave their faucet or tap running while using them for washing or toothbrushing which wastes a vast amount of water.
* Prepare too much food and throw away the leftovers.

The activities in which industries impacts the environment negatively and exhausting the natural resources includes: 

* Mining and deforestation that does not follow the standards set by the government. Some of the companies are not replacing the trees they cut. 
* Polluting the land, air and water and not managing their waste efficiently.
* Emitting too much carbon dioxide and harmful chemicals that continues to warm up the Earth’s atmosphere which results in climate change.
* Extracting and drilling too much oil and gas which ruins wildlands and disrupts wildland habitats. 

The world can already feel the effects of unsustainable ways we are consuming our resources and abusing the planet. Some places in the world are experiencing water, oil and gas shortages, the species of animals becoming extinct. In the future, the impact of human activities will become even more dangerous. 

The United Nations and many organizations are conducting and implementing programs for responsible consumption of resources. The government regulates policies that improve sustainability. Some of these solutions include: 

* Implementing more power-efficient devices.
* Reducing deforestation activities and tree planting programs
* Recycling and reusing materials.
* Practicing sustainable agriculture. 
* Improving waste management.
* Implementing more renewable energy equipment such as solar panels/funnels, power plants, etc. 
* Harnessing environmental power which is very sustainable as it prevents burning of oils to produce electricity. 

It is important that people are aware of how much they are consuming and what impact they have on the environment. Ecological footprint is a way to measure resource consumption. It compares human demand on nature with the biosphere’s ability to regenerate resources and provide services. According to these measurements, in the past few years, the human consumption exceeds the amount of resources the Earth can produce globally. This basically means that people are overconsuming and exhausting resources that are for the future. We have what we called Earth’s Overshoot Day which marks the date when humanities demands for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what Earth can regenerate in that year. In 2021, it fell on July 29. So from July 30 to the end of the year, humanity will overconsume. 

# Problem Statement

The depletion of environmental resources can be attributed to overpopulation. An increase in population means more demand for the basic needs that come from nature. However, a bigger factor that contributes to exhaustion of environmental resources is the inefficient way humanity is using them. In recent years, the world consumes more than the renewable resources can regenerate and yet many people still experience hunger. Although there are many different ways in which people can create positive contributions, the majority of them are not aware of their individual impact on the environment.
